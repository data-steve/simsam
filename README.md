**simsam** is a data simulation tool used to generate random data
sets that maintain similar structure to an origin data set. Instead of the typical bootstrap samples that sample rows of data with replacement, to get a more simulation feel, we do bootstrap sampling on individual columns in lieu sampling from formal distribution,e.g., `rnorm()`
